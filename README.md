This a mix of a couple different repositories: [OpenAI-CLIP](https://github.com/moein-shariatnia/OpenAI-CLIP), [VisionDiff](https://github.com/Aveygo/VisionDiff), and [ConvNextv2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt-V2)

Currently the model is able to train and generalise, however the exact viability of this method is currently unknown until more research is performed.
